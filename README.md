## Delayed-Flight

**Introduction**

This project explores the prediction of flight delays and cancellations using machine learning techniques. It utilizes the publicly available Flight Delay Dataset (2018-2022) from Kaggle ([Flight Status Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/flight-delay-dataset-20182022)).

**Project Goals**

This project aims to:

- Train machine learning models to predict whether a flight will be cancelled or delayed.
- Develop a model to estimate the potential delay time for flights.

**Methodology**

1. **Data Acquisition:** The Flight Delay Dataset is downloaded from Kaggle.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** The data is cleaned, explored to understand its characteristics, and  undergoes feature engineering to create new relevant features from existing ones. SimpleImputer is used for null values and data is standardised
3. **Model Training:**
    - **Cancellation Prediction:** A Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier (SGDClassifier) is employed to predict flight cancellations. Model hyperparameters are tuned to optimize performance.
    - **Delay Prediction:** A Stochastic Gradient Descent Regressor (SGDRegressor) is used to estimate the delay time for flights. Hyperparameter tuning is also applied here.
4. **Model Evaluation:** The performance of both models is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and mean squared error (MSE) for the regression task. Cross-validation techniques (e.g., k-fold cross-validation) are used to ensure robust and generalizable results.
5. **Results Analysis:** The performance metrics and any visualizations from the evaluation stage are analyzed to assess the effectiveness of the trained models. The limitations of the models are acknowledged, and potential areas for improvement are identified.

**Implementation Details**

The project is implemented in one Jupyter Notebook, linked here: [Flight Delay Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/code/atharva729/flight-delay-prediction). This notebook provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the methodology described above.

**Dependencies**

This project requires the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

**Further Considerations**

- **Feature Engineering:** Explore the creation of new features from existing ones to potentially improve model performance.
- **Model Selection:** Experiment with different machine learning models beyond SGDClassifier and SGDRegressor to potentially achieve better results. This could involve methods like random forests, XGBoost, or neural networks.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Employ more sophisticated hyperparameter tuning techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV for more efficient optimization.
- **Error Analysis:** Analyze the types of errors made by the models to identify patterns and areas for improvement.
